                    &#183; Auora has a histoty of innovation. From the introduction of the industry's first
                    non-proprietary, web standards-based IP control systems and touch panels to today's advanced HDBaseT
                    and 1G & 10G video distribution solutions, Aurora has become a dominant force in the AV industry.

                    &#183; A few years ago, signal transmission technology came to fruition, and Aurora became a part of
                    the first innovation with NETGEAR. About six years ago, Aurora had a device that received the power,
                    and they were one of the only ones on the market.

                        Just as much as we needed a switch to test with, they needed a device to prove their circruitry
                        worked,
                    </q>
                    Harris said of the partnership with NETGEAR.
                    <q>
                        So, that was the beginning of a really nice relationship that was actually over 10G with PoE.
